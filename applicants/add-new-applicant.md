## Sending the Application Invitation

You will need to manually email the applicant the unique URL and there are two copying options.

### Copy All Text

If you click the copy all text button, the text as seen in the popup will be copied to your clipboard and can be pasted into your preferred email client for sending to the prospective tenant.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you edit the text, don't delete the "complete application" text as that contains the unique URL. If you accidentally delete, close the popup, edit the applicant and click save again.
{% endhint %}

### Copy Link

If you prefer to use your own wording, text message or app to send the link, you can click on the "copy link" button next to the URL. Then paste the copied URL into whatever you're using to communicate with the prospective tenant.

Close the popup when copied.
