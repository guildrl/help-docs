# Viewing and Using Applicant Data

Once an applicant has completed the form, you will receive an email confirming.

## Viewing the Data

To view the data, go to the applicant tab and select "view" from the actions button.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2021-10-05 at 15.51.19@2x.png>)

All data can be viewed and the headings can be clicked to reveal more (e.g. address history).

## Application Progress

At the top you can see "application progress".

This allows you to track what stage of the referencing you are at (if you're anything like me, I always loose where I am in the process).

Each option can be altered by using the dropdown and clicking the tick button to save.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Non of the options are automated at this stage. You will need to manually keep them up to date.
{% endhint %}

You can also tick the boxes if a holding deposit has been paid and the application success/failure notifications have been sent (we don't provide those, it's just for you to track).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Viewing the data looks a little rudimentary at the moment! We are focusing on ensuring it's stable and working at the moment and will look to make it prettier in the future.
{% endhint %}

## Generate a PDF

A PDF of the data can be generated and downloaded to your computer for safe storage using the button at the bottom of the view.

## Create a Tenancy Assessment Report (Credit Check)

You can very quickly create a new reference for the applicant by [adding a new reference](../referencing/new-report.md) and from the "add from applicants" dropdown, select the applicant you want (you can also search).

![](<../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2021-06-23 at 14.20.37@2x.png>)

On selecting, all data will be populated into the fields.

{% hint style="danger" %}
As applicants is still in beta stage, please check the data has populated correctly before submitting for a reference!
{% endhint %}

## Insert Into Tenancy Builder

You can quickly add the applicant details into a tenancy agreement being built with the Builder.

[Add a new tenancy](../create-a-new-agreement.md) (or [edit an existing one](../edit-an-agreement.md)) and next to tenant details, select the record from the "add from applicants" dropdown. You can also search.

Once selected, all data will be added into the tenant fields.

The same happens on the guarantor page (if one).

## Home Office Share Code

In the uploads section of the application form, the applicant is able to provide a Home Office Share Code. This code can be seen under the uploads/right to rent section when viewing an applicant and [please see here for more information about using the code.](https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-rent)
