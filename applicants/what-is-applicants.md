# What is Applicants?

The applicants section is used to provide a prospective tenant who is interested in your property with an online application form for them to complete. This is better than a paper form in the modern day.

Once the applicant completes the form, the data is viewable from the applicants view and the information can be used for referencing and adding new tenants in Tenancy Builder.
