# Credits

We use credits to pay for extras such as digital signing or referencing (but see later as you get some free).

100 credits are required for each [digital signing](digital-signing-1.md) irrespective of the number of parties signing (it's per agreement not per signing party).

900 credits are required for a [tenancy assessment report](referencing/new-report.md) (similar to credit report).

We have provided some free credits to users on most subscriptions to get you started and at each renewal you will get free credits as below:

* £29 per quarter = 300 free credits per renewal
* £90 each year = 1200 free credits per renewal
* £129 each year = 1500 free credits per renewal

The same credits as above are provided free on [first signup](https://landlordsguild.com/amember/signup) as a new subscriber.

### Purchase Credits

{% hint style="info" %}
If your credit activity looks a little strange, we had a little trouble when allocating the initial free credits! Don't worry, it should be correct but if you think the number of credits allocated is wrong, [please get in touch](https://www.landlordsguild.com/about-us/contact\_us/).
