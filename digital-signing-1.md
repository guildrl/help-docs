# Digital Signing

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're using the **previous version of Tenancy Builder** and want help with remote signing, [please see this help article](https://www.landlordsguild.com/admin-tech-support/remote-signing-in-tenancy-builder/).
{% endhint %}

One of the greatest features of Tenancy Builder is the integrated digital signing.

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to use digital signing, the agreement must have first been "built" and a downloadable PDF available. When using digital signing, we automatically upload the last built PDF agreement and this will be used for the signing.

The field "[is this to be draft](draft-agreement.md)" must be set to "no" in order to use digital signing.

A digital signing costs 100 [credits](credits.md). Subscribers are given free credits each time you join/renew and also a number of credits were given for free on launch of the new Builder to get you started.
{% endhint %}

## Credits

If you don't have sufficient [credits](credits.md) (100 are required), the link for digital signing will instead say "digital signing (purchase credits)". Clicking the link will divert you to the [credits purchase page](https://www.landlordsguild.com/amember/signup/EAHIiqDlj).

{% hint style="success" %}
The 100 credits is irrespective of the number of the number of parties signing. It’s per document not per signatory
{% endhint %}

## Procedure for using digital signing

After an agreement has been built, you should check the contents of the PDF carefully by [downloading](download-an-agreement.md) and checking.

Once the PDF has been checked, from the actions button in the tenancies list, click on "Digital Signing".

## Fields

### From / Notification Email

When an email is sent to a party for signature (e.g. the tenant), this email will be the ”from” and ”reply to” address as the party will see it in their email client.

This email will also be used for notifying you when a party has signed and when the agreement has been completed (signed by all parties).

3. Guarantor 3 (if one)

As one party signs, the system automatically sends an email to the next party in the list and so on until all parties have signed.

Once completed, all parties get an email with the final PDF signed agreement to retain.

## Digital Signing Events

You can view events as the signing progresses through by clicking ”digital signing events” in the actions button from the tenancies list.

![Digital Signing Events](<.gitbook/assets/Tenancy Manager - Tenancy List (6).png>)

From there you can view all the events (when sent, opened and signed etc.)



## Cancel a document

Before the document has been completed, it can be cancelled.

Simply [go the digital signing events page](digital-signing-1.md#digital-signing-events) and in the top right corner click "cancel".

## Download completed agreement

Once all parties have signed, the document will be marked as completed (which can be seen in the events page).

{% hint style="warning" %}
It can take a while (several minutes) after the last party has signed before the agreement is marked as completed.
{% endhint %}

Once the agreement has been marked as completed, the document will be automatically emailed to all parties or, the document can be downloaded for you to store somewhere safe.

The document can be downloaded by either clicking ”download final” from the actions button in the tenancies list (the system overwrites the last built agreement with the signed one). Or, go to the digital signing events page (via the actions button) and click download final at top right.

All parties will also receive an email with the document attached and a link to download.

## I've Realised the Document Has Been Sent With a Wrong Email Address

If the agreement has been submitted for remote signing and you realise there's a wrong email address been entered for one of the parties, you'll be able to change the email after it's bounced. You will receive an email and follow the instructions.
