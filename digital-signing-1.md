# Digital Signing

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're using the **previous version of Tenancy Builder** and want help with remote signing, [please see this help article](https://www.landlordsguild.com/admin-tech-support/remote-signing-in-tenancy-builder/).
{% endhint %}

One of the greatest features of Tenancy Builder is the integrated digital signing.

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to use digital signing, the agreement must have first been "built" and a downloadable PDF available. When using digital signing, we automatically upload the last built PDF agreement and this will be used for the signing.

The field "[is this to be draft](draft-agreement.md)" must be set to "no" in order to use digital signing.

A digital signing costs 100 [credits](credits.md). Subscribers are given free credits each time you join/renew and also a number of credits were given for free on launch of the new Builder to get you started.
{% endhint %}

## Credits

If you don't have sufficient [credits](credits.md) (100 are required), the link for digital signing will instead say "digital signing (purchase credits)". Clicking the link will divert you to the [credits purchase page](https://www.landlordsguild.com/amember/signup/EAHIiqDlj).

{% hint style="success" %}
The 100 credits is irrespective of the number of the number of parties signing. It’s per document not per signatory
{% endhint %}

## Procedure for using digital signing

After an agreement has been built, you should check the contents of the PDF carefully by [downloading](download-an-agreement.md) and checking.

Once the PDF has been checked, from the actions button in the tenancies list, click on "Digital Signing".

Next is to check all fields are completed correctly. Party emails must be unique.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Check the spelling of all emails because the system will cancel the document if an email bounces back. This will cost extra credits to send again!
{% endhint %}

![Ensure all party names and emails are completed](<.gitbook/assets/Tenancy Manager - Remote Signing.png>)

{% hint style="danger" %}
It’s important to **ensure all party names and emails are filled in, spelt correctly and unique**.

To add multiple parties with one email address, see next section.

The from / notification email can be the same as another email (e.g. landlord email can be same as the from email). It’s only party emails which must be unique.
{% endhint %}

## How To Add Multiple Parties With One Email Address

Let's say we have multiple signers under the email address janettest@yopmail.com

{% hint style="danger" %}
Setting two parties under the same email will result in an error.
{% endhint %}

**However, we can do the following:**

1. Set the first signer under the regular email: janettest@yopmail.com
2. Set the second signer under the following address: janettest**+1**@yopmail.com

Doing that you can send 2 or more e-mails to the same address with the Builder.

![](<.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2021-01-23 at 15.33.30@2x.png>)

This works with any written text after + e.g. "janettest+2", "janettest+husband", "janettest+partner", etc.)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Most modern e-mail services are supporting this "plus extension" of the name part of the address and they are received in the default inbox. (This has been verified with Gmail).

**Use with caution as not all email providers might support this**.

_As a means of testing this, you could send the party with the +1 (or whatever) a test email and ask for a reply. That way you'll know if they will receive the modified email before submitting._
{% endhint %}

## Fields

### From / Notification Email

When an email is sent to a party for signature (e.g. the tenant), this email will be the ”from” and ”reply to” address as the party will see it in their email client.

This email will also be used for notifying you when a party has signed and when the agreement has been completed (signed by all parties).

### From Name

The from name as will be displayed in the email requesting a signature.

### Tenancy Address and Fixed Term

These are read only fields so you can be confident you have selected the correct agreement for digital signing.

### Guarantor Name and Guarantor Email

If there’s a guarantor, these will be displayed and must be completed.

Check all are spelt correctly.

### Tenant Name and Email

For each tenant, the name and email as previously entered will be displayed. If any are blank, they must be filled in.

Check all are spelt correctly.

### Landlord Signers Name and Email

For each landlord signer, the name and email as previously entered will be displayed. If any are blank, they must be filled in.

Check all are spelt correctly.

### How signing (remote or in person)?

Two options are available.

* Send by email to each party
* In person signing

#### Send by email to each party

This is the remote signing option. When selected and after submission, an email will be sent to every party one by one in the same order as seen on screen.&#x20;

As one party signs, the system automatically sends to the next party in the list and so on until all parties have signed.

Once completed, all parties get an email with the final PDF signed agreement to retain.

#### In person signing

In person signing does not send emails to any party. Instead, after submission and the remote signing has been succesfully created, you will be able to select each party from a dropdown and then each party can sign on that device. Once all parties have signed, the document will be available to download.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you plan to do in person signing, you will need some device connected to the internet such as a phone or tablet (or desktop computer in an office for example).

You will require internet to access the Tenancy Builder and then select the parties.

If you plan to do in person signing at the rental property, ensure there will be internet access before selecting this option.
{% endhint %}

## Send by email (remote signing)

After submission, an email will be sent to every party one by one in the same order as seen on screen. The emails will be sent in the following order:

1. Guarantor 1 (if one)
2. Guarantor 2 (if one)
3. Guarantor 3 (if one)
4. Guarantor 4 (if one)
5. Guarantor 5 (if one)
6. Guarantor 6 (if one)
7. Guarantor 7 (if one)
8. Guarantor 8 (if one)
9. Guarantor 9 (if one)
10. Tenant 1
11. Tenant 2 (if one)
12. Tenant 3 (if one)
13. Tenant 4 (if one)
14. Tenant 5 (if one)
15. Tenant 6 (if one)
16. Tenant 7 (if one)
17. Tenant 8 (if one)
18. Tenant 9 (if one)
19. Relevant person (someone who paid deposit on behalf of tenant, if one)
20. Landlord signer 1
21. Landlord signer 2 (if one)
22. Landlord signer 3 (if one)
23. Landlord signer 4 (if one)

As one party signs, the system automatically sends an email to the next party in the list and so on until all parties have signed.

To see broadly what a party will see when clicking the link in the email, see below [in person signing](digital-signing-1.md#in-person-signing-1) as the view is essentially the same.,&#x20;

Once completed, all parties get an email with the final PDF signed agreement to retain.

## Digital Signing Events

You can view events as the signing progresses through by clicking ”digital signing events” in the actions button from the tenancies list.

![Digital Signing Events](<.gitbook/assets/Tenancy Manager - Tenancy List (6).png>)

From there you can view all the events which is updated live (no need to refresh the screen).

## In person signing

To use in person signing, after clicking submit, you will be sent back to the tenancies list. Click on the actions button for the tenancy just sent and click on ”digital signing events”

![](<.gitbook/assets/Tenancy Manager - Tenancy List (6).png>)

Once in the events page, there is a dropdown selection box in the top right corner where a party can be selected.

![](<.gitbook/assets/Tenancy Manager - Events (2).png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
Parties can be selected in any order when using in person signing.
{% endhint %}

On selecting a party, a popup will appear with a preview of the document.

Click on ”start” in the top right which will scroll to the first signature box for that party.

![](<.gitbook/assets/Tenancy Manager - Events (3).png>)

![](<.gitbook/assets/Tenancy Manager - Events (4).png>)

The party should be handed the device being used and tap on the signature box to reveal the signing element. The party should sign and then click the ”sign” button.

A signature can be signed or uploaded.

If more signatures are required, they can click ”next” in the top right to scroll straight to the next element.

![](<.gitbook/assets/Tenancy Manager - Events (5).png>)

Once all have boxes have been signed, the party will be asked to confirm by agreeing terms.

The next party can then be selected for signature and so on until all parties have been completed.

## Cancel a document

Before the document has been completed, it can be cancelled.

Simply [go the digital signing events page](digital-signing-1.md#digital-signing-events) and in the top right corner click "cancel".

![](<.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2021-01-21 at 09.10.41@2x.png>)

## Download completed agreement

Once all parties have signed, the document will be marked as completed (which can be seen in the events page).

{% hint style="warning" %}
It can take a while (several minutes) after the last party has signed before the agreement is marked as completed.
{% endhint %}

Once the agreement has been marked as completed, the document will be automatically emailed to all parties or, the document can be downloaded for you to store somewhere safe.

The document can be downloaded by either clicking ”download final” from the actions button in the tenancies list (the system overwrites the last built agreement with the signed one). Or, go to the digital signing events page (via the actions button) and click download final at top right.

![Download from actions button](<.gitbook/assets/Tenancy Manager - Tenancy List (7).png>)

![Download from digital signing page](<.gitbook/assets/Tenancy Manager - Events (6).png>)

All parties will also receive an email with the document attached and a link to download.

## I've Realised the Document Has Been Sent With a Wrong Email Address

If the agreement has been submitted for remote signing and you realise there's a wrong email address been entered for one of the parties, [please see this section.](troubleshooting/wrong-email-address-in-digital-signing.-how-do-i-resend.md)
