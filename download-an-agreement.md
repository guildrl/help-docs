# Download an Agreement

To download an agreement, there are two ways.

* click the green ”completed” notice to the right of the tenancies list
* select ”download last buil” from the actions button

Depending on your browser settings, the agreement will likely appear on screen (otherwise it may download to a specific folder as per your personal computer settings). Assuming displayed on screen, download as you normally do any other PDF document displayed in your browser.

### After Digital Signing

If you have completed digital signing, the wording in the actions button will say ”download final”. Instead of downloading the originally built agreement, you will be downloading the completed and signed agreement.

Alternatively you can click on digital signing events in the actions button and then download final from the top right.
