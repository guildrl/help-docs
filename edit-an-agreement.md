# Edit an Agreement

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are using the **previous version of Tenancy Builder** and want to know how to find previous agreements and edit them, [please see this help article](https://www.landlordsguild.com/admin-tech-support/where-to-find-saved-agreement/).
{% endhint %}

As long as digital signing has not been started, you can edit an agreement anytime.

Simply click ”edit” from the actions button next to the agreement you want to edit in the tenancies list and follow the same procedure as [creating a new one](create-a-new-agreement.md).

{% hint style="danger" %}
After making your changes, if you select "save for later only" before submitting, this will only save the data you changed in the database and **WILL NOT** be reflected in the downloadable PDF agreement.&#x20;

To make the changes show in the downloadable PDF, you must select "**save and build**" before submitting. This will create a new agreement (with the edited changes) and overwrite the last one built which can then be downloaded after it's been built.

If you only have a small edit, you don’t have to go through every page by clicking next, next, next ...

Instead, you can jump between pages by clicking the numbers at the top.
