# Add or Edit Activity (Reports)

## Add new activity

First go to the inventory list and select to view a tenancy from the actions button.

From the list of tenancies, click on the actions button and select "Add/View Activity".

Select whether check-in, interim or check-out, the date and optionally meter readings at that time.

On submitting, a PDF "snapshot" of the inventory template will be created. You will be returned to the activity list where it will show in progress to begin with (like when building a tenancy agreement) and when ready, will show as completed.

To download the inventory, click on the green success message or choose download from the actions button.

## Edit activity

To edit an activity, from the actions button in the list, click edit and make necessary changes.

{% hint style="danger" %}
When submitting, the PDF report generated will be overwritten.

If you want a new activity (as opposed to editing existing), add new by following earlier steps.
{% endhint %}
