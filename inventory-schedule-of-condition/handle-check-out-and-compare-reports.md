# Handle Check Out and Compare Reports

Let's say you created a new template with the condition of the property at that time. Then 18 months later, the tenants have left the property. Here is the procedure:

First, edit the inventory template by going through each item and changing the condition and comments of each item as appropriate.

Then go to the template tenancy -> activities.

Create a new activity and select "check-out", enter the date and meter readings at check out.

On submitting, a new report will be generated.

Tick two compare boxes for the reports to compare, and a "compare" button appears to click.

On comparing, a screen will appear showing the differences between the two documents.

Scrolling down further shows the two PDF reports side by side for further comparison.
