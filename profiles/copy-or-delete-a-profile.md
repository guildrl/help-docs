# Copy, Edit or Delete a Profile

Once created, a profile can be copied, edited or deleted.

Copying a profile will be useful if you wish to have a profile for every letting unit.

Let's say you have four flats in a building - Flat 1,2, 3 and 4. You could create the first profile and in the description call it "Flat 1 xxx". In the tenancy address field, enter the full address. Once all fields have been filled in and saved, you could copy the profile then edit by changing the description name and tenancy address. Everything else will already be entered. Hit save and you now have another letting unit profile. Hit copy again and repeat.

To copy, edit or deleted, use the actions button from the profiles list.

A message will display confirming deletion (and will have disappeared from the list).

{% hint style="danger" %}
For speed, there's no confirmation dialog so use delete with care!
{% endhint %}
