# Create and Use Profiles

### What are profiles?

Profiles allow you to enter repetitive information once and then when creating a new tenancy agreement, with one click all that information will be populated instantly.

The information which can be added includes:

* landlord name
* notifications email
* landlord email
* usual tenancy agreement type (e.g. AST)
* usual deposit scheme used

### Create a new profile

To create a new profile, select "profiles" from the sidebar and "Add New" on the right.

Once in the add new screen, you must give the profile a name in the "description" field.

This description will be displayed in the dropdown to select the profile when creating a new tenancy

{% hint style="success" %}
The description name can be searched in the dropdown when adding a new agreement.
{% endhint %}

Continue to enter all the information asked for. See the creating an agreement section for descriptions of each field.

{% hint style="info" %}
You only need complete fields you want to. You can leave fields blank if you prefer.
{% endhint %}

### Testing Logo

Within profiles, adding a logo has a unique option not available when creating a tenancy namely: testing logo.

To add a logo, select the "choose file" button and choose your preffered logo. It should be jpg, jpeg or png.

After the logo has been added and the profile saved, a "Test Logo" button is visible. On clicking, a test front page will open in a new window after a few seconds. This will show if the logo is working and you can check the dimensions and quality.

A few notes about profiles:

* profiles are optional. You don't have to create one to create a new agreement
* you can use unlimited profiles
* you can have one profile for all tenancies (leave the tenancy address blank in the profile) or, you can have multiple profiles such as one for each letting unit.
