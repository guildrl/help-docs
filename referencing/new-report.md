{% hint style="info" %}
If the property is a flat but the flat doesn't show up in the address list, you can manually add flat number in the "flat" field.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
This address is the **proposed tenancy address** and NOT the applicant's address.
{% endhint %}

### Proposed Rent (PCM)

Enter numbers only.

### Applicant Details - Name

![](<../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2021-01-21 at 10.06.02@2x.png>)

### Date of Birth

By using the selection boxes, enter the proposed tenant's date of birth.

### Adverse Records

Has the applicant informed you of any adverse records (e.g. county court judgments or bankruptcy)?

This question should have been asked of the applicant via a suitable application form.

Select yes or no (default is no).

### Applicant's Current Address

Start typing the address or postcode and choose the applicant's current address from the list provided.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The system will only work and be able to locate an applicant if the address is on the list of Royal Mail addresses for the UK.

Overseas addresses won't work. If someone has been overseas for a period, you may need to extend the months and years of a UK address to "fool the system" in proceeding but such an action may result in the reference not being found.
{% endhint %}

### How long at current address?

Using the the dropdown, select years and months at current address.

### Previous Address 1

Where the applicant has been living at their current address for less than 3 years, repeat as above but for their previous address.

### Previous Address 2

Where the total years of current address plus previous address 1 are less than 3 years, previous address 2 will appear. Enter details by repeating above.

This is the last address needed even if the total of all years remains at less than 3 years.

### Confirmation

Confirm the statement by checking the box and click submit.

The data will be sent to the credit bureau where a report will be produced.

## Afer Submitting

After submitting, you will be returned to the referencing list and you will be able to see live progress of the report similar to when building a tenancy agreement.

{% hint style="info" %}
Sometimes, the report is delayed because it needs to go to the bureau for human intervention. It's unclear why and when this happens but is fairly rare.

If this happens, you will get an email.

We will chase the report with the bureau but it can take up to 1 full working day before returned when this happens.

The report will be sent as soon as it's ready.
