# What is Referencing (Tenancy Assessment Report)?

The referencing section is a tenancy assessment report which is similar to a credit check (it's not possible to credit check a tenant because no credit is being provided).

Accessing the new referencing can be found here: [https://docs.landlordsguild.com/referencing](https://docs.landlordsguild.com/referencing)

The tenancy assessment report checks public data such as:

* Electoral roll check at the applicant’s current and previous addresses.
* A tenancy assessment score, predicting the applicant’s likelihood to pay.
* A Public Information check to ascertain whether the applicant has CCJs, bankruptcy orders or voluntary arrangements.
* A check to see if the applicant has any undisclosed addresses.
