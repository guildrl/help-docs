# Agreement Not Showing in Tenancies List

On very rare occasion, we have heard reports of a tenancy being created but when returning to the list of tenancies, the agreement is not shown in the list.

If this happens, please try adding a new agreement (add new at top right of the tenancies list) and if the pop-up appears, click "restore". Please carefully check the contents that were restored, as some data may nevertheless be missing. Try building the newly restored agreement, which should now work.

We are investigating the cause, but it is very rare indeed.
