# Check Status Page

If the Tenancy Builder or referencing service experiences an error that is due to a 3rd party service being down, we automatically update our [dedicated status page](https://status.landlordsguild.com) and investigate the issue.

In addition, if we are aware of an issue, in most cases we will add this to the status page so you can track progress of it being fixed.

This is the first thing you should check if you experience any problems or delays with the Builder or referencing.

The status page will tell you if there are any known issues which might cause a delay in the producing of an agreement or reference.
