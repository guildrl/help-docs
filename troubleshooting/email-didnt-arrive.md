# Email Didn't Arrive

The email we send is only to say the agreement is ready for download. The email no longer includes the attachment as this makes it more likely to arrive and not seen as spam.

The status of producing an agreement is live and once completed, you can [download the agreement](../download-an-agreement.md) from the tenancies list even if you haven't received an email.

If the agreement hasn't completed after 5 minutes, check the [status page](https://status.landlordsguild.com) to see if there any known issues.
