# Submit Button Won't Work

If you get to the end of the Builder (usually page 6) and clicking submit does nothing, this means a field has incorrect data somewhere.

The first thing to check is the number fields such as rent and deposit on page 1. If you've put something other than a number (e.g. "Â£") it won't work. A fix to notify users when a non number character is inserted is being pushed to the live site soon.

Otherwise, check all dropdowns options. The following are mandatory and must be selected:

### Page 1 (Tenancy Details)

* country (England or Wales)
* tenancy type
* deposit status

### Page 6 (Other and Save)

* business type of person signing

### If still won't work

If the submit button doesn't work after checking all fields, don't hesitate to get in touch via the chatbot in the bottom corner or via our [contact page](https://www.landlordsguild.com/contact/).
