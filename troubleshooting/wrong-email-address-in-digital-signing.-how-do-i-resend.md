# Wrong Email Address in Digital Signing. How Do I Resend?

If you've entered the wrong email for one of the parties in digital signing, this can be fixed and the document resent with relative ease.

### What if digital signing email bounces?

If the digital signing attempts to send to an invalid email, the document will be "bounced" and the [digital signing events page](https://help.landlordsguild.com/digital-signing-1#digital-signing-events) will show this.

When a document has bounced this way, the document will also be automatically cancelled.

If you have realised thereâ€™s a wrong email address before the system has tried sending to that party, you will need to manually cancel the document yourself.

### Cancel the document

Simply go to the [digital signing events page](https://help.landlordsguild.com/digital-signing-1#digital-signing-events) and click "cancel" in the top-right corner. [See this section for more in-depth information on cancelling a document](https://help.landlordsguild.com/digital-signing-1#cancel-a-document).

### Edit the agreement

Once the document has been cancelled, you can edit the agreement in the usual way. [See here for more information on editing an agreement](https://help.landlordsguild.com/edit-an-agreement).
