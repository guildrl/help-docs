# Wrong Email Address in Digital Signing.

If you've entered the wrong email for one of the parties in digital signing, this can be fixed during the process.

If the digital signing attempts to send to an invalid email, the document will be "bounced" and the [digital signing events page](https://help.landlordsguild.com/digital-signing-1#digital-signing-events) will show this.

When a document has bounced this way, you will be emailed. Follow the link in the email to update the details (change the email) and it will be sent to the revised email. You are also asked for a reason when changing details. This is for the audit trail attached to the final agreement so you could put something like "first email entered incorrectly".
